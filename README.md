In this project, I employed the A* algorithm to plan a path from starting to goal point.
The project was realized in a series of steps starting from implementing the algorithm, reading the data from different sources, CRUD operation examples.

Due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency, A-star (also referred to as A*) is one of the most successful search algorithms to find the shortest path between nodes or graphs. It is an informed search algorithm, as it uses information about path cost and also uses heuristics to find the solution.

The Path Planning algorithm is described in the below flowchart.
